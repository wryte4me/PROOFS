## Introduction

Thesis title consultation services started as freebies for those who availed academic writing services back then. Due to popular demand, we decided to add thesis title consultation services for those who struggle to get their thesis titles approved by their research panel or professors. This service is perfect for individuals who want to minimize their expenses by writing their own research papers with our guidance and for those who find it challenging to generate unique and innovative research-worthy ideas.

Posted here are the screenshots of Google Meet video conference consultation meetings. The standard layout includes a screenshot showing the current time and date, starting from September 30, 2024. The anonymity of the clients will be preserved by covering their names and profile pictures (if necessary). The only details that will be tied to the screenshot are the time and date of the consultation, the course being taken by the clients, and the location of their school.
